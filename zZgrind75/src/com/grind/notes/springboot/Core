Equals Hashcode Contract
	1) Both equals must be true and hashcode must be equal.
	2) hashcode equal doestn't mean both object are equal
	3) calling hashcode multiple times should return the same value. 
	
Why above is important
 1) doesn't matter if you don't use them in collections but if you use them in collection then though 
    both objects might be equal but if they don't have same hashcode then they are treated as separate
    objects by hashmap and they end up as different elements contrary to what you are trying to achieve.
